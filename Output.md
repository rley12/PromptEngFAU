- **Financial Reports**: Companies often publish detailed reports on their financial performance, which can be analyzed using financial statements.
- **Social Media Platforms**: LinkedIn, Facebook, and other platforms where users share news articles or stock quotes.

### Step 2: Identify Key Financial Metrics Influencing Stock Overvaluation

To identify key financial metrics that influence stock overvaluation, we need to consider the following:

1. **Market Capitalization (MKT):** This metric measures the total value of a company's shares on the stock market.
   - **Impact**: A high MKT can indicate higher valuations due to strong investor interest.

2. **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio):**
   - **Impact**: The P/E ratio indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings per share. A higher P/E ratio generally suggests a more overvalued stock.
   - **Example**: If the P/E ratio is 15, this would indicate that investors expect a company’s earnings to be worth $15.

3. **P/B Ratio (Price-to-book Ratio):**
   - **Impact**: The P/B ratio measures how much each dollar of equity represents in terms of book value per share.
   - **Example**: If the P/B ratio is 10, this would indicate that investors are willing to pay $10 for each dollar of earnings.

4. **Dividend Yield:**
   - **Impact**: Dividend yield reflects how much a company pays out as dividends versus its earnings. A higher dividend yield generally means a more overvalued stock.
   - **Example**: If the dividend yield is 5%, this would indicate that investors are willing to pay $5 for each dollar of earnings.

5. **Price-to-Sales (P/S Ratio):**
   - **Impact**: The P/S ratio measures how much each dollar of sales represents in terms of tangible assets.
   - **Example**: If the P/S ratio is 10, this would indicate that investors expect a company’s sales to be worth $10 per dollar of earnings.

6. **Current Ratio:**
   - **Impact**: A high current ratio indicates that a company has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its short-term obligations.
   - **Example**: If the current ratio is 2, this would indicate that a company can pay for each dollar of sales with $2 worth of assets.

### Step 3: Define System Requirements for an AI Tool

Based on the identified financial metrics:

1. **Market Data Sources (Twitter, News Articles):**
   - Use APIs or scraping tools to collect market data from platforms like Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, and Reuters.
   - Ensure that the data is up-to-date and relevant.

2. **Financial Metrics Analysis Tools:**
   - Use machine learning algorithms to analyze the financial metrics mentioned above.
   - Implement sentiment analysis techniques using natural language processing (NLP) models to assess the sentiment associated with each metric.
   - Consider incorporating domain-specific knowledge or expert opinions for more nuanced insights.

3. **Real-Time Data Handling:**
   - Handle real-time data streams from Twitter, news articles, and financial reports.
   - Implement a system that can process large volumes of data quickly without compromising accuracy.

4. **Visualization Tools:**
