# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project in form of:
* Complete missing code
* Experiments with Prompt Engineering Techniques 
* Research Reports. 

Please use Issues or email to reach out to talk about new ideas, or submit your code or report.

To start contributing, follow the instruction on `How to Configure the Lab Environment` in [README.md](./README.md).

(Note: for FAU students, please use CANVAS to submit the Assignment, when applicable.)


# !!! Immediate Help Needed !!!

**Update** the ready-to-go techniques with examples in Requirement Analysis 
> Note: these templates have phony examples around math tests

* Update [Zero Shot](prompt-eng/zero_shot.ipynb)
* Update [Few Shot](prompt-eng/few_shots.ipynb)
* Update [Prompt Template](prompt-eng/prompt_template.ipynb)
* Update [Chain-of-Thought](prompt-eng/chain_of_thought.ipynb)

**Complete** desirable techniques:

* Complete [Meta Prompting](prompt-eng/meta.ipynb)
* Complete [Self Consistency](prompt-eng/self_consistency.ipynb)

**Create** missing entries:
> Note: I suggest to copy&paste prompt-eng/zero_shot.ipynb and use as template, adjusting the code

* Create **Generate Knowledge Prompting** (`prompt-eng/generate_knowledge.ipynb`)
* Create **Prompt Chaining** (`prompt-eng/prompt_chaining.ipynb`)
* Create **Retrieval Augmented Generation** (`prompt-eng/rag.ipynb`)

**Research** about the possibility to create these other techniques:
* Automatic Reasoning
* Automatic Prompt Engineer
* Active-Prompt
* Directional Stimulus Prompting
* Program-Aided Language Models
* ReAct
* Reflexion


# Experiments with Prompt Engineering Techniques 

This is a List of Ideas on possible research and experiments with Prompt Engineering Techniques that we would like to incorporate to the Prompt Engineering Lab.

1. Experimenting with different Prompt Templates applied to Use Cases to to attain best accuracy.
1. Improving or completing the code for the Prompt Engineering Technique to support new Use Cases
1. Creating a new code for other Prompt Engineering Technique 
1. Experiments with combinations of Automated Prompt Generation in a chained process
1. Experiments with combinations of Prompt Engineering Technique, Automated Prompt Generation, and variation of Model Parameters, to identify best performance both for latency and accuracy.

### Outcomes

* **Good Code** and **Good Use Cases** will be invited to integrate the new related of the Prompt Engineering Lab


# Contributing with Research Reports

If you would like to contribute with a Research Report describing the results of your exploration, please use the template provided at:

[Research Report Template](./MY-REPORT.md)


### Outcomes 

* **Good Research Reports** will be invited to extend and internal publication
* **Exceptional Research Reports** will be invited to extend and external publication in a venue to be defined! The reports include:
    * Experiments to generate data to support comparative analysis between method, techniques, and variations of parameters.
    * Good visualization e.g. diagrams and graphs presenting the experiments and results.
